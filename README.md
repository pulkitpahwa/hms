#HOSTEL LEAVE MANAGEMENT PROJECT

##Problem that were faced earlier :

*Difficulty in getting an outpass
*A lot much office work for the hostel staff
*Manual errors while merging the attendance record with outpass record
*Sending SMS manually to the parents of those students who are not present in the hostel and are not on outpass too
*Sometimes SMS is sent to wrong users, who are not ought to receive that message

##Solution : 

*An online outpass management web app that students can use anytime, from anywhere to generate outpass 
*The web app will take attendance from biometric reader and will update it record daily and will automatically find out the students who are absent from the hostel without permission
*Sending SMS automatically on a single click(Require warden's permission)
*Proper security features to ensure data backup and security
*Update would be sent to warden's account and other staff's account when an outpass is issued
*Outpass would be generated either as SMS (providing necessary information about the outpass ) that could be sent to student's account or could be downloaded as a pdf file, thus saving the paper consumption.
*Records monitoring tool to allow staff members to get custom results
